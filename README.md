# Quantitative_Resistance

The need for a quantitative approach in antibiotic resistance research.

To make life easier in both a clinical and modelling context, antibiotic resistance is often treated as a binary phenotype. That is, bacteria are considered resistant if they can grow in the presence of a single ‘breakpoint’ concentration of a given antibiotic, and sensitive if they cannot, creating the illusion of 2 discrete categories. In reality, resistance is not a binary phenotype; the specific antibiotic concentration that prevents bacterial growth (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, MIC) is a quantitative, continuously distributed variable. While this binary picture is useful, there is little research into how well it fits real life data, nor whether there are consequences if it does not. Here we analyse genotypic and phenotypic data to determine how appropriate it is to treat resistance as a binary phenotype. We then explore possible consequences of treating resistance as a binary phenotype on an epidemiological and within-host level using mathematical models. Our findings indicate that, for many antibiotic-bacteria combinations, resistance is a quantitative genetic trait which does not form discrete, binary phenotypes. Furthermore, it suggests that there are both epidemiological and clinical consequences of assuming the contrary, including the apparent stable co-existence of “resistant” and “sensitive” bacteria, and differences in optimal antibiotic dose.
